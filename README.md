# Salesforce Bulk API Tool (Bulk Delete) üöÄ‚ú®

This project provides a tool to perform bulk deletions on Salesforce objects via the Bulk API 2.0. Use it to remove large amounts of records quickly and efficiently! ‚ö°

## Requirements
1. Python 3.6 or later.  
2. Required libraries (listed in requirements.txt), such as:  
   ‚Ä¢ simple_salesforce  
   ‚Ä¢ requests  
   ‚Ä¢ python-dotenv  
   ‚Ä¢ pandas  
3. Valid Salesforce credentials (SF_USERNAME, PASSWORD, TOKEN).  
4. A .env file containing the environment variables (credentials and SOQL query).

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Clone this repository.  
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   ```
   python -m venv venv  
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Unix-based systems:  
      ```
       source venv/bin/activate 
      ```
   ‚Ä¢ Windows:  
      ```
       .\venv\Scripts\activate  
      ```
3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
4. Create or edit your .env file based on the .env.example. Make sure to include the following variables:  
   ‚Ä¢ SF_USERNAME  
   ‚Ä¢ PASSWORD  
   ‚Ä¢ TOKEN  
   ‚Ä¢ DOMAIN (e.g., login or test)  
   ‚Ä¢ OBJECT_NAME (e.g., Account)  
   ‚Ä¢ SOQL_QUERY (the query to retrieve the records to delete)

Example .env:  
```
SF_USERNAME=your.salesforce.username@example.com  
PASSWORD=your-salesforce-password  
TOKEN=your-salesforce-token  
DOMAIN=test  
OBJECT_NAME=Account  
SOQL_QUERY=SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE LastModifiedDate = YESTERDAY LIMIT 10  
```
## Usage üèóÔ∏è
1. Check the src/example_usage.py file to see how to load config from the .env file and execute the bulk deletion.  
2. Run the script:  
   ```
   python src/example_usage.py  
   ```

A log file named bulk_delete.log will be created, containing details of the operation.  

## Project Structure
- src  
  - salesforce_bulk_delete.py: Core logic to connect to Salesforce and manage bulk deletion jobs via the Bulk API 2.0.  
  - example_usage.py: Example script demonstrating how to read environment variables from a .env file and perform bulk deletions.  

## Important Notes üîí
- Do NOT commit real credentials to public repositories. Use environment variables or a secure vault.  
- Always validate your SOQL query before performing a large-scale deletion.  
- Test in a sandbox or staging environment before running it in production.
